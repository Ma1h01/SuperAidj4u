# SuperAidj4u

The project is a full-stack web application designed to integrate multiple e-stores into a single platform, providing comprehensive inventory management for e-commerce vendors. This platform enables vendors to manage their stores hosted on third-party platforms (such as Amazon, eBay, TikTok) from one centralized location. Vendors can accept and adjust purchase orders, select the best deals for couriers, and manage shared inventory across all stores.

This project is built with Next.js and MongoDB and is currently under active development.
